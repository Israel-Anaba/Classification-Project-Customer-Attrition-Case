# Customer Churn Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning üìà üëç üëé

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project, a Supervised Machine Learning endeavor focused on customer churn analysis and retention strategies. In this project, we diligently adhered to the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. By examining data variables and employing various techniques, we aim to predict and mitigate customer churn.

**Project Workflow:**

- **Data Collection:** Customer data was collected from various sources, including SQL Server tables and CSV/Excel files, covering demographics, services, payment, and churn status.
- **Data Processing:** Collected data was transformed into a suitable format using libraries like pyodbc and pandas, creating a comprehensive dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Extensive EDA was performed, including data summarization, handling missing values, and univariate and bivariate analyses, using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data was cleaned, missing values handled, and categorical variables transformed, making it ready for in-depth analysis with pandas.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Hypotheses on customer churn were formulated and tested using various statistical methods, including scipy's hypothesis tests.
- **Visual Insights:** Compelling visualizations were created to answer key questions about customer churn, using matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Power BI Deployment:** Analysis and visuals were deployed in Power BI for interactive exploration and sharing.
- **Data Balancing:** Class imbalance was addressed using the SMOTETomek technique.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Multiple machine learning models were trained, evaluated, and assessed, using classification reports with F1-score as the evaluation metric.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** The best-performing model was fine-tuned as needed.
- **Advanced Model Improvement:** Hyperparameter tuning was performed for selected models using GridSearchCV.
- **Future Predictions:** The trained model can be deployed for ongoing predictions on new data, allowing proactive measures for customer retention.
